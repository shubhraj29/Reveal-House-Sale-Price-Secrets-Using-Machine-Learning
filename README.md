# Reveal-House-Sale-Price-Secrets-Using-Machine-Learning

Objectives

- To develop a predictive model using the Random Forest algorithm that accurately forecasts house prices based on a range of features.
- Demploying SHAP analysis to interpret the Random Forest model, providing insights into how different variables influence the prediction of house prices.
- Identify and rank the most significant factors affecting house sales prices through comprehensive SHAP value analysis.

Setup

- pandas for managing the data.
- numpy for mathematical operations.
- sklearn for machine learning and machine-learning-pipeline related functions.
- seaborn for visualizing the data.
- matplotlib for additional plotting tools.
- shap for explain the model.
